    "===========================================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "What this script does\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "- Defines a 2D synthetic objective (Franke function) on [0,1]^2 to **maximize**.\n",
    "- Uses your **language_shaped_prior_llm.py** helpers (Schema, PriorBuilder, etc.).\n",
    "- Fits a **GP on residuals** (y - m0(x)), then wraps it with a deterministic prior mean m0(x)\n",
    "  so the acquisition sees the **total posterior = m0(x) + GP_residual(x)**.\n",
    "- Runs an **analytic EI** loop (q=1) and tracks best-so-far.\n",
    "- Provides example readouts (flat, helpful, misleading) so you can compare how priors change performance.\n",
    "- Jupyter-friendly: functions return pandas DataFrames; one-liner demo at bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage (in Jupyter)\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "1) Ensure `language_shaped_prior_llm.py` is importable (we add '/mnt/data' to sys.path by default).\n",
    "2) Run this cell/file; then run the demo cell at the very bottom (or call `compare_readouts(...)`).\n",
    "3) Optional: call `plot_runs(history_df)` to visualize best-so-far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependencies\n",
    "------------\n",
    "- torch >= 1.11, botorch, gpytorch, numpy, pandas, matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes\n",
    "-----\n",
    "- We use **analytic ExpectedImprovement** (EI) so we don't need fantasies.\n",
    "- The wrapper model ensures EI evaluates improvement on the **total** posterior (m0 + residual GP),\n",
    "  which is the principled way to use a shaped prior with BO.\n",
