      "Use a slight excess of benzaldehyde relative to acetone (e.g., ~2:1 ratio) to drive the crossed aldol condensation toward benzylideneacetone and minimize self\u2011condensation of acetone",
      "Operate in a protic solvent like ethanol or water/ethanol mixture to enhance enolate formation yet allow precipitation of product for easy isolation",
      "Maintain moderate base loading\u2014just enough NaOH to generate acetone enolate but avoid excessive base that may promote retro\u2011aldol or Cannizzaro side reactions",
      "Optimize reaction temperature within a moderate range (e.g., 30\u201170\u202f\u00b0C) to balance enolate formation rate with minimizing side reactions and unwanted polymerization",
      "Use short residence time (5\u201315\u202fmin) in flow to enhance productivity while minimizing retro\u2011aldol degradation of the product",
      "Efficient mixing of acetone enolate with benzaldehyde\u2014such as pre\u2011mixing base and acetone then gradual addition of benzaldehyde\u2014helps favor the desired crossed product",
      "Encourage precipitation of benzylideneacetone during reaction to shift equilibrium via product removal from the reactive medium",
      "Minimize dilution to maintain effective concentrations but avoid too concentrated solutions that lead to oily by\u2011product formation and impurity incorporation",
      "Control water content carefully; sufficient water helps enolate generation but excess dilution can lower yields as seen in water/acetone systems",
      "Ensure efficient downstream purification\u2014rapid cooling and filtration or crystallization help preserve high yield by capturing the product before degradation"
