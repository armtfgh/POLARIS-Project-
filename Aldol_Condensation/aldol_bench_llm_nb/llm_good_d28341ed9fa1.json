      "Optimize four continuous variables: acetone equivalents (moleq2), base equivalents (moleq3), temperature (temp), and residence time (time); target yield only.",
      "Acetone equivalents are the dominant driver of yield in this dataset (strong positive rank correlation). Expect a saturating or shallow-peak response: yield increases steeply from low eq and levels off around ~10\u201315 eq, with no consistent benefit at extreme excess.",
      "Temperature shows a weak\u2013moderate positive trend up to ~55\u201360 \u00b0C, with no consistent gain beyond; encode a weak nonmonotone-peak or gentle saturating increase for temp.",
      "Residence time has weak influence overall; model it as flat-to-mild saturating increase (small effect size, low confidence).",
      "Base equivalents (moleq3) vary narrowly (~0.02\u20130.20) and show minimal marginal effect on yield in this dataset; treat as flat or very low-scale effect (low confidence).",
      "Prefer at most one weak interaction: allow a soft synergy between moleq2 and temp (higher acetone usage expresses better at moderate temperatures), with low\u2013moderate confidence; otherwise keep interactions off."
